    <h1>Rank Correlation</h1>
    <p class="intro">Rank correlation, also known as non-parametric correlation, measures the degree of association between two variables based on the ranks of their values rather than their actual values. Rank correlation is often used when the data is not normally distributed or when the relationship between variables is non-linear. <br>Here are some common applications of rank correlation:</p>
    <h1><b>Applications of Rank Correlation</b></h1>

    <p><b>Medical Research:</b><br>

       <br>In clinical trials, researchers may use Spearman's rank correlation to assess the relationship between two variables, such as a patient's age and their response to a particular treatment. This is useful when the data is not normally distributed, or when the variables are measured on an ordinal scale.</p>

    <p> <b> Education Assessment:</b><br>

    <br></br>  In educational research, Spearman's rank correlation can be used to measure the relationship between students' rankings in different subjects. For example, it can help determine if there is a consistent pattern in how students perform across various subjects. </p>
